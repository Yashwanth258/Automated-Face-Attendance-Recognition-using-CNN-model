The Automated Attendance System by Facial Recognition is a contactless, AI-powered solution that streamlines attendance management using real-time face detection and recognition. Built with Python, OpenCV, Flask, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the system captures live facial images, compares them with a pre-registered database, and automatically logs attendance with timestamps. It replaces traditional methods like roll calls, RFID cards, and fingerprint scanners, offering higher accuracy, speed, and hygiene. With a user-friendly web interface, audio alerts, and CSV-based reporting, the system is ideal for educational institutions and workplaces, enhancing efficiency, security, and user experience.
